        <h5>CONFIDENTIALITY</h5>
        <p>
            You further acknowledge that the Platform may contain information that is designated confidential by us and
            that
            you shall not disclose such information without our prior written consent. Your information is regarded as
            confidential and therefore will not be divulged to any third party, unless if legally required to do so to
            the
            appropriate authorities. We will not sell, share, or rent your personal information to any third party or
            use
            your e-mail address for unsolicited mail. Any emails sent by us will only be in connection with the
            provision of
            agreed services, and you retain sole discretion to seek for discontinuation of such communications at any
            point
            in time.
        </p>

        <h5>OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTORS</h5>
        <p>
            Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and
            disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other
            parties, whether they are on our Platform or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply
            to
            their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party
            advertisers, they adhere to their privacy policies. Since we do not control the privacy policies of third
            parties, you are subject to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
        </p>

        <h5>OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h5>
        <p>
            Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and
            other
            personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy
            Policy. By way of example (without limiting and foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the
            government, law enforcement agencies or third parties. Therefore, although we use industry-standard
            practices to
            protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable
            information or private communications would always remain private. We do however assure you that any
            disclosure
            of your personally identifiable information shall be personally intimated to you through an email sent to
            your
            provided email address.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third
            party. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may
            be
            disclosed:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a. External Service Providers: There may be several services offered by external service providers that
                help you
                use our Platform. If you choose to use these optional services, and in the course of doing so, disclose
                information to the external service providers, and/or permit them to collect information about you, then
                their
                use of your information is governed by their privacy policy.
            </li>
            <li>
                b. Law and Order: We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce
                laws,
                such as intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose
                any
                information about you to law enforcement and other government officials as we, in our sole discretion,
                believe
                necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property
                infringements, or
                other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PROFILE</h5>
        <p>
            You can review and change the information you submitted except Email ID. An option for facilitating such
            change
            shall be present on the Platform and such change shall be facilitated by the User. If you change any
            information, we may or may not keep track of your old information. We will not retain in our files
            information
            you have requested to remove for certain circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems,
            and
            enforce our terms and conditions. Such prior information shall be completely removed from our databases,
            including stored ‘back up’ systems. If you believe that any information, we are holding on to you is
            incorrect
            or incomplete, or to remove your profile so that others cannot view it, the User needs to remediate, and
            promptly correct any such incorrect information.
        </p>

        <h5>SECURITY</h5>
        <p>
            We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many
            different
            security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and outside the Firm. We
            follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us and
            information
            that we have accessed.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. Our Firm cannot
            guarantee
            the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you provide won’t be intercepted while
            being
            transmitted to the Firm over the Internet.
        </p>

        <h5>SEVERABILITY</h5>
        <p>
            Each paragraph of this Privacy Policy shall be and remain separate from and independent of and severable
            from
            all and any other paragraphs herein except where otherwise expressly indicated or indicated by the context
            of
            the agreement. The decision or declaration that one or more of the paragraphs are null and void shall not
            affect
            the remaining paragraphs of this privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h5>AMENDMENT</h5>
        <p>
            Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use
            of
            your information and will always be on the Platform. Any amendments to this Policy shall be deemed as
            accepted
            by the User on their continued use of the Platform.
        </p>

        <h5>CONSENT WITHDRAWAL, DATA DOWNLOAD & DATA REMOVAL REQUESTS</h5>
        <p>
            To withdraw your consent, or to request the download or delete your data with us for any or all our services
            at
            any time, please email to “info@arogyasamriddhi.com”

        <h5>DISCLAIMER</h5>
        <p>
            We do not store any account related information or any credit / debit card details. We shall not be liable
            for
            any loss or damage sustained by Users as a result of any disclosure (inadvertent or otherwise) of any
            information concerning the User's account, credit cards or debit cards in the course of any online
            transactions
            or payments made for any products and/or services offered through the Platform.
